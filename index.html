		My name is Kitty Leong Ian Tong. I am a fifteen-year-old girl. I live in Taipa with my parents and my brother. Let me tell you more about my hobbies, personality, favorite subject and dream.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		I am an energetic, cheerful and humble girl. In my leisure time, I like reading books, especially detective stories. They can help to train my logical thinking. Every Saturday, I practice swimming because it not only makes me strong but also builds up my self-discipline.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		As for my character, I am hard-working and will not give up easily. I will overcome setbacks and serve others. I am honest and outgoing too.
	</p>
	<p>
		My favourite subject is Mathematics. I find this subject very challenging because I need to be very careful when I am doing calculations. Besides, it is very useful as we can apply mathematical concepts to our daily life. I can bargain for cheaper prices in the market.
	</p>
	<p>
		Finally, I am looking forward to enjoying my school life in Sacred Heart Canossion College(English Section) Macau and I believe I can gain precious memories in my school life.
